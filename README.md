Submission for the CSSU Purefacts Winter 2023 Programming Challenge.


  To get an output of some file in the shell, after line 186, add the command:
  print(get_max_free_time(<filename>))

  A tuple output from this command can also be obtained by following the instructions on line 180.
  I have added two of the test csv files provided in the repo itself to test the function.

  Thanks for the fun challenge Purefacts, Andrew, and the other two people I don't know the name of.
